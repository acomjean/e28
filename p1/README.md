## Notes for instructor
I'm getting how this works, but am still struggling a little how the overall application should be structured. It seems like a big class, but I'm not comfortable
yet.

Tables don't work easily in view, unlike divs .  I thought a table would be appropriate for scoreing, so I after some digging I used the v-is tag.
I should use more components.
